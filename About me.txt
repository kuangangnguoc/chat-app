My name is Phuong Le. You can call me Linda, and I'm studying in Interactive Media.

I am interested in game 3d modelling and donging art toys. In addition, I think game development also is
a good choice to study if I want to work in gamme industry. I also love to create my own website and I'm
studying about it.
